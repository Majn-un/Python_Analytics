{"text":"Peggy and Patricia,\n\nThis is the last allocation exception I have to clear.  When you have the \ntime, could you check the volumes for gas days 28 - 31 for October, 1999.  I \nphoned Peggy this morning regarding this meter, and apparently it is outside \nmeasured.  I need to verify that flow occured so that I can have a deal(s) \nextended to allocate the flow to.\n\nThank you again for all of your assistance, I really appreciate all that you \nhave done.\n\nMary\n\nDaren,\n\nI am going to leave a copy of the meter volume, and prior purchases to review.\n\n\nThank you for you assistance and patience.\n\nMary","headers":{"message-id":"<16824631.1075854140029.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Wed, 1 Nov 2000 01:18:00 -0800 (PST)","from":"mary.poorman@enron.com","to":"peggy.cameron@enron.com, patricia.kirkwood@enron.com","subject":"Meter 980070 Lonestar/HPL Rusk for 10/99","cc":"daren.farmer@enron.com, pat.clynes@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"daren.farmer@enron.com, pat.clynes@enron.com","x-from":"Mary Poorman","x-to":"Peggy Cameron, Patricia Kirkwood","x-cc":"Daren J Farmer, Pat Clynes","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Darren_Farmer_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Logistics","x-origin":"Farmer-D","x-filename":"dfarmer.nsf"},"subject":"Meter 980070 Lonestar/HPL Rusk for 10/99","messageId":"16824631.1075854140029.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"mary.poorman@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"peggy.cameron@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"patricia.kirkwood@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"daren.farmer@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"pat.clynes@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"daren.farmer@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"pat.clynes@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2000-11-01T09:18:00.000Z"}
