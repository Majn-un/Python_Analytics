The best way to reach me is really at work (this\naddress), but I do check the home account a few times a week.\n\nAnyway, how are you?  It must be wierd seeing your own company in the news\neveryday.  Kim said that you were in a good spot to rebound if you needed\nto when the dust settles.  That is a relief to us.\n\nAs far as the adoption stuff......we still have a long way to go.  Our home\nstudy is being written up this week; we've finished the interviews and have\nall of our documents into the social worker.  We are hopefully going to get\nnotification from the INS to get our fingerprints done within the next week\nor so.  We're hoping the INS stuff goes quickly, because that is really the\nonly major thing we have left to get done.\n\nWe don't know where in Kazakhstan we're gonna go yet, but, we are about a\nmonth from getting our name on the referral list; we'll probably find out\npossible locations then.  I don't know how much Kim relayed to you, but\nwe're hoping for a healthy infant, and the rest doesn't matter as far as\npreferences.  We are pretty excited already.\n\nHow is Alina? (spelling?)  Kim's description of her sounds wonderful.  You\nguys must be having a terrific time getting to know each other again after\na few months separation.\n\nLets definitely stay in touch.  Maybe the next time you come through DC we\ncan have you over or meet somewhere.\n\nAnyway, say hi to everyone for us.\n\nLove,\n\nKurt\n\nkschier@market-bridge.com\nw - 301-961-8936\nh - 202-234-8045\nLisa and Kurt Schier\n2029 Park Road, NW\nWashington, DC 20010","headers":{"message-id":"<20209423.1075861078391.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 14:14:42 -0800 (PST)","from":"shelley.corman@enron.com","to":"cormanerb@cs.com","subject":"FW: Hi","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Corman, Shelley </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SCORMAN>","x-to":"'cormanerb@cs.com'","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Shelley_Corman_Mar2002\\Corman, Shelley\\Sent Items","x-origin":"Corman-S","x-filename":"scorman (Non-Privileged).pst"},"subject":"FW: Hi","messageId":"20209423.1075861078391.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"shelley.corman@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"cormanerb@cs.com","name":""}],"date":"2002-01-25T22:14:42.000Z"}
