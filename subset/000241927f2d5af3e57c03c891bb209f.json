{"text":"\n\nDarrell\n\nI was speaking with Linda Ward and she mentioned that there is displacement on POI 8042 PEPL Hansford Cactus.\nThis point is not showing in Model Office because in PLE is a delivery point, but it is currently in production as a valid receipt because it is part of the Panhandle all receipt template in CBS.  Call us Monday morning if we should be including this point as displacement SP group Panhandle.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\nMaggie","headers":{"message-id":"<18625006.1075860758421.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 14:10:37 -0800 (PST)","from":"maggie.matheson@enron.com","to":"darrell.schoolcraft@enron.com","subject":"POI    8042","cc":"ramona.betancourt@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"ramona.betancourt@enron.com","x-from":"Matheson, Maggie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MMATHES>","x-to":"Schoolcraft, Darrell </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dschool>","x-cc":"Betancourt, Ramona  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbetanc>","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Darrell_Schoolcraft_Mar2002\\Schoolcraft, Darrell\\Inbox\\Junk","x-origin":"Schoolcraft-D","x-filename":"dschool (Non-Privileged).pst"},"subject":"POI    8042","messageId":"18625006.1075860758421.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"maggie.matheson@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"darrell.schoolcraft@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"ramona.betancourt@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"ramona.betancourt@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2002-01-25T22:10:37.000Z"}
