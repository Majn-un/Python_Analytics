D.00-08-023 and\nD.00-09-075.  These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire\non or before 12-31-05.  Initial contracts are subject to a blanket\nreasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of\nportfolio=deemed reasonable)  but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject\nto a CPUC preapproval process.\n\nGas:   PG&E authorized to use gas hedges for all purposes (D.98-12-082) but\nlimited to contracts expiring on or beforce 12-31-02 and limited to $200\nmillion in cost or 800 MMcfd in volume.  We are looking for a similar\nresolution or decision for Sempra.  Haven't found it yet, but we believe\nthey have been given similar authority.  \n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<5109239.1075851604515.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Mon, 16 Jul 2001 18:27:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"barry.tycholiz@enron.com","to":"jeff.dasovich@enron.com","subject":"RE: Utility authority to engage in derivative transactions","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Barry Tycholiz <Barry Tycholiz/ENRON@enronXgate>","x-to":"Jeff Dasovich <Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron>","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Dasovich, Jeff (Non-Privileged)\\Dasovich, Jeff\\Deleted Items","x-origin":"DASOVICH-J","x-filename":"Dasovich, Jeff (Non-Privileged).pst"},"subject":"RE: Utility authority to engage in derivative transactions","messageId":"5109239.1075851604515.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"barry.tycholiz@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"jeff.dasovich@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-07-17T01:27:00.000Z"}
