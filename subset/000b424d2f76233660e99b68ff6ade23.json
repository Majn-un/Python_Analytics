If not, could\nyou please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are\na few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the\nFT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they\nwere put into this book automatically.\n\nQ24809.1\nQ47957.1\nQ50596.1\n\nCould you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston\nbooks, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties\nin these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing\non Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS\nbook by the end of today.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions on this matter.\n\nThanks for your help\nStacey\n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<13819894.1075854404775.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Fri, 27 Oct 2000 03:58:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"darron.giron@enron.com","to":"jason.wolfe@enron.com","subject":"Deals in the MGMT-WEST book","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Darron C Giron","x-to":"Jason Wolfe","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Darron_Giron_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","x-origin":"Giron-D","x-filename":"dgiron.nsf"},"subject":"Deals in the MGMT-WEST book","messageId":"13819894.1075854404775.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"darron.giron@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"jason.wolfe@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2000-10-27T10:58:00.000Z"}
