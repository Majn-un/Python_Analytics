{"text":"FYI\n---------------------- Forwarded by Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron on 04/12/2000 \n11:49 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nShelley Corman\n04/12/2000 11:45 AM\nTo: Robert Hill/NPNG/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Jeffrey Keeler/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON \n\nSubject: Background Materials for the INGAA Board Meeting\n\n\nBob,\nI generally prepare a package of briefing materials for Stan Horton prior to \nINGAA Board meetings.  Since you are attending in his place, I'm planning on \ndoing the same for you.  I'll forward a complete package tomorrow.  In the \nmeantime, I wanted to give you a heads up on two issues that will likely come \nup at the meeting.\n\n\nPipeline safety.  There is a great deal of activity  of this issue.  The \naccident in Bellingham Washington has politicians taking the opportunity to \npush for tougher state oversight authority and more money to the states.  \nLast week a grass roots group called the National Pipeline Coalition met to \nrally support for state oversight.  INGAA's general reaction has been to \ndistinguish gas and liquids lines and refer to the gas pipeline safety \nrecord.  To the extent that we have distinquishing factual (not hypothetical) \ndate,  think this information will be useful in any substantive pipeline \nsafety legislation.  However, the more immediate issue is appropriations.  \nJeff Keehler reports that while safety legislation is not likely this year, \nhe is certain that we will confront appropriations issues in the form of \nhigher user fees.  INGAA's approach has been to say absolutely that user fees \nfor gas pipelines should not be increased.  When we met with Stan Horton last \nweek, he felt like we should develop a compromise position on some level of \nuser fee increases that we could support if spent on pipeline damage \nprevention (one call) and other public education efforts.  Jeff agrees that a \ncompromise might be a good political solution, allowing the Washington \ncongressional members to claim victory in bringing home more money to the \nstates.  Jeff plans to finish his memo on our compromise position in the next \nday or so.  The next step will be convincing INGAA to look at some compromise \nrather than flatly rejecting user fees.  It may be appropriate for Enron to \nask that INGAA set up a meeting of the Board level safety task force to \nconsider such a compromise.\nElectric Restructuring Legislation.  Cynthia Sanherr informs me that several \nof the combined gas/electric utility members (e.g. Duke) are lobbying INGAA \nto change its position on pending electric legislation in a direction that is \ncounter Enron's interests.  I need to get more detailed notes from Cynthia \nand will include in your Board package.  She expects this to come up at the \nBoard meeting.\n","headers":{"message-id":"<2557776.1075844949452.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Wed, 12 Apr 2000 04:51:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"shelley.corman@enron.com","to":"stanley.horton@enron.com","subject":"Background Materials for the INGAA Board Meeting","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Shelley Corman","x-to":"Stanley Horton","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Stanley_Horton_1\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads","x-origin":"HORTON-S","x-filename":"shorton.nsf"},"subject":"Background Materials for the INGAA Board Meeting","messageId":"2557776.1075844949452.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"shelley.corman@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"stanley.horton@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2000-04-12T11:51:00.000Z"}
