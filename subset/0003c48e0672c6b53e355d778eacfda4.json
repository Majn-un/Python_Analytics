I told him that it might\nprove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in\nWashington a week or so ago, she said that the \"Digital Divide\" was the \nhottest\ntopic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so \nthat\nbusinesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we\nwant to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity\nand platform in Washington!\n\nJust thought I should give you \"heads-up\" in case he asks and please tell \nLinda\nI said hello!\n\nThank you for doing so much for the cause!\n\n\nTerry Pierce\nEnron Broadband Services\nCorporate Marketing\nSr. Manager/Special Projects\n(713)345-8383 Office\n(713) 503-0700 Cell\n\n\n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<2275320.1075840282440.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Mon, 3 Apr 2000 12:19:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","to":"terry_pierce@enron.net","subject":"Re: Conversation w/President & Mrs. Bush","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Rosalee Fleming","x-to":"Terry_Pierce@enron.net","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Kenneth_Lay_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Sent","x-origin":"LAY-K","x-filename":"klay.nsf"},"subject":"Re: Conversation w/President & Mrs. Bush","messageId":"2275320.1075840282440.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"terry_pierce@enron.net","name":""}],"date":"2000-04-03T19:19:00.000Z"}
