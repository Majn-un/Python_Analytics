This is not\nfinal and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for\nour review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish\naddressing the open issues, which are:\n\n\t1.\tHow should we describe the Change of Control exception for\nWarburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future\nfinancing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?\n\n\t2.\tWe need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).\nKiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.\n\n\t3.\tWe need to confirm what information will be included in the\nEnron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.\n\n\t4.\tI deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the\nassumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.\n\n\t5.\tI would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex\nApplication is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.\n\n\tThere may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most\nof it.\n\n\tTravis, I will call you tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\tBest regards,\n\n\tTed\n\n The following files have been attached to this email by DeltaView...\n\nMarch 14 CoMarketing Agreement.DOC  ( WORD97 )\nRedline.rtf  ( Rich Text Format )\n          ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++\nThe information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.
