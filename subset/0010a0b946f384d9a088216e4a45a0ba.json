{"text":"Where mountains touch Big Sky\nAnd clear waters amplify\nA transient souls request\nDoes Montana meet the test? ? ? YUP!\n\nIn Southwest Montana snow capped peaks feed clear mountain lakes and streams. \nAs these high mountain water sources merge in the lower valleys they foster \nmore stunning scenery and create the Madison River ecosystem.\n\nThis magnificent watershed nurtures fish and wildlife habitat of unequaled \nsplendor.\n\nYou are invited to join us at the 2000 YPO Montana Experience and indulge the \noutdoor adventure of your choice. Horseback rides into the Spanish Peaks, fly \nfishing on the Madison, white water float trips via the Bear Trap\nExpress and upland bird hunting at the Diamond Wing Hunting Reserve are but a \nfew of the options available. Couple all this with real Montana hospitality \nreflective of a cultural heritage rooted firmly in the traditions of the Old \nWest.\n\nDates for the YPO Montana Experience are October 5th-8th, 2000.
