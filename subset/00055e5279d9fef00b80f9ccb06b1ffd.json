BRCM did the same thing today taking resistance at 50.  a close beneath the 13-day EMA constitutes the roving cautionary flag as GNSS has had an excellent relationship with the 13-day EMA since the green bar birthed in november.  GNSS has not closed beneath the 13-day EMA since.  so the 13-day EMA is the yardstick.\n\nwaiting i am for the next julianna hatfield concert!  unfortunately the best thing to be had at the local casino of choice is Styx.\n\nkensey\nSee the annotated graph of this recommendation at:\n\nhttp://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/bbs?Cmd=post&post_id=2822414\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-\nRecommend emails are a powerful way to get investment tips as they happen\nfrom the ClearStation community.
