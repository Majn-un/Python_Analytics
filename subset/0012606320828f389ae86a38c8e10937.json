{"text":"Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed \ndistribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe \ncontract.\n\nThe report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an \neconomic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not \nexhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if \nuseful we will spread the net. \n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nEnron stock option plans: \n\nENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global \nFinance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.\n\nJ Block CRTA:\n\nWe have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on \nthis contract.\n\nKorea:\n\nUSD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's \ncurrency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since \nJanuary.\n\nBrazil:\n\nArgentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in \nJanuary. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.\n\n\n\n\nThoughts and comments welcome.\n\nRgds\nDP\n     \n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<2203442.1075842062863.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Thu, 5 Apr 2001 07:26:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"david.port@enron.com","to":"greg.whalley@enron.com","subject":"Position Report","cc":"rick.buy@enron.com, vince.kaminski@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"rick.buy@enron.com, vince.kaminski@enron.com","x-from":"David Port","x-to":"Greg Whalley","x-cc":"Rick Buy, Vince J Kaminski","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Lawrence_Whalley_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads","x-origin":"WHALLEY-G","x-filename":"gwhalley.nsf"},"subject":"Position Report","messageId":"2203442.1075842062863.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"david.port@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"greg.whalley@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"rick.buy@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"rick.buy@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-04-05T14:26:00.000Z"}
