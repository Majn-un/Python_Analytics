{"text":"\n\n_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________\n\nXP COUNTDOWN: MORE OF YOUR TOP QUESTIONS ANSWERED\n\n    In the last month and a half, I've been inundated\n         with XP-related questions from faithful\n         AnchorDesk readers. Can you upgrade? Is XP\n         faster than 9x? What's the deal with licensing?\n         Join me as I do some eXPlaining.\n\nhttp://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1023/2819476:8593142\n\n\n   PLUS: NO APOLOGIES?

To understand\n    this basic idea is to understand Sun,\n    Microsoft and their dueling ambitions\n    for Web services.\n\n    PLUS:\n\n    HEY COUCH POTATOES, SONY'S HANDHELD IS A CLICKER, TOO.\n    NEW CRUSOE NOTEBOOK TO HIT U.S. SHORES\n\n\nhttp://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1023/2819493:8593142\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________EXPERT ADVICE_____________________\n\n\nJohn Morris and Josh Taylor\n\n  WHY INTEL COULDN'T MAKE ITS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FLY\n\n   Long the king of PC microprocessors, Intel\n         thought it could rule the world of consumer\n         electronics, too. Not so. Josh and John find\n         Intel's decision to abandon consumer products\n         disappointing, but not surprising.\n\n\nhttp://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1023/2819482:8593142\n\n\n\t\t\t> > > > >\n\n\nPreston Gralla\n\n  END THE BOREDOM!
