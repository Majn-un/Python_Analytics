{"text":"Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting \nfrom their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise \nand incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  \nMark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim \nBruno at FERC later today.\n\nAn additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform \nCommittee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor \noperations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to \nmeet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John \nShelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say \"Enron OnLine\" \nthey mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader \nsubject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or \notherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than \nthe platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the \nbenefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the \nDC office.  \n\nPlease call me with any comments at 37007.","headers":{"message-id":"<14985046.1075852011189.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Thu, 28 Jun 2001 02:20:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"christi.nicolay@enron.com","to":"louise.kitchen@enron.com, greg.whalley@enron.com, andy.zipper@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com, mark.haedicke@enron.com, elizabeth.sager@enron.com, jeffrey.hodge@enron.com","subject":"Response to FERC: EOL","cc":"sarah.novosel@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, lisa.yoho@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"sarah.novosel@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com, lisa.yoho@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com, linda.robertson@enron.com, steven.kean@enron.com","x-from":"Christi L Nicolay","x-to":"Louise Kitchen, Greg Whalley, Andy Zipper, John J Lavorato, Mark Taylor/Enron@EnronXGate, Mark E Haedicke, Elizabeth Sager, Jeffrey T Hodge","x-cc":"Sarah Novosel, James D Steffes, Lisa Yoho, Richard Shapiro, Linda Robertson, Steven J Kean","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Richard_Shapiro_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\Enron online","x-origin":"SHAPIRO-R","x-filename":"rshapiro.nsf"},"subject":"Response to FERC: EOL","messageId":"14985046.1075852011189.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"christi.nicolay@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"louise.kitchen@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"greg.whalley@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"andy.zipper@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"john.lavorato@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"mark.haedicke@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"elizabeth.sager@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"jeffrey.hodge@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"sarah.novosel@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"james.steffes@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"lisa.yoho@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"richard.shapiro@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"linda.robertson@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"steven.kean@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"sarah.novosel@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"james.steffes@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"lisa.yoho@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"richard.shapiro@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"linda.robertson@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"steven.kean@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-06-28T09:20:00.000Z"}
