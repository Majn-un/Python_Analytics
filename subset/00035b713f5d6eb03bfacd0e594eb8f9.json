By September of that year the \nDow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September \nof '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly \nspeculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in \nDecember of '70.  \n\nBy April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  \nFebruary of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high \nof  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 \nthe Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the \nDow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and \ngeniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking \nopenly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom\n\nAnd that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its \nway down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were \nwrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.\n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<10923805.1075858415057.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Mon, 23 Apr 2001 05:41:00 -0700 (PDT)","from":"scott.neal@enron.com","to":"andrew.lewis@enron.com","subject":"","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Scott Neal","x-to":"Andrew H Lewis","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Scott_Neal_Jun2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","x-origin":"Neal-S","x-filename":"sneal.nsf"},"messageId":"10923805.1075858415057.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"scott.neal@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"andrew.lewis@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-04-23T12:41:00.000Z"}
