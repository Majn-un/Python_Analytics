{"text":"Jeff,\n\tThanks for the e-mail. One question, why is the PG&E curve lower in price going forward than the wholesale curve price.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tRichter, Jeff  \nSent:\tThursday, September 06, 2001 9:33 AM\nTo:\tStokley, Chris; O'Neil, Murray P.\nSubject:\tPricing\n\n\nChris and Murray,\n\nHere is the embedded generation curve vs current day wholesale prices through March - 02.  We cannot break down what the generation cost is by primary, secondary, and transmission.  Hope this is helpful.\n\nJeff\n\n << File: Curves.xls >> \nJeff Richter                            503.464.3917 (w-pdx)\nEnron North America                            503.701.6488 (c)\nWest Power Services                          503.464.3740 (fax)\n121 SW Salmon Street 3WTC0306       jeff.richter@enron.com\nPortland, Oregon  97204","headers":{"message-id":"<18691408.1075858500522.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Thu, 6 Sep 2001 07:41:27 -0700 (PDT)","from":"chris.stokley@enron.com","to":"jeff.richter@enron.com","subject":"RE: Pricing","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Stokley, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MSTOKLE>","x-to":"Richter, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jrichte>","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Stokley, Chris (Non-Privileged)\\Chris Stokley\\SENT","x-origin":"Stokley-C","x-filename":"Stokley, Chris (Non-Privileged).pst"},"subject":"RE: Pricing","messageId":"18691408.1075858500522.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"chris.stokley@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"jeff.richter@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-09-06T14:41:27.000Z"}
