{"text":"I have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th. My intent had been to join Rick's meeting at the halfway point at 2:30 under the original schedule.  With the time change of Rick's meeting to a 1:30 start, I will now miss his meeting.  Please let him know that I will be in the budget review meeting with EGM during that time period.  Thanks.  --Sally \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWestbrook, Sharron  \nSent:\tWednesday, October  10, 2001 3:22 PM\nTo:\tBeck, Sally; Becker, Melissa; Brown, Bill W.; Butts, Bob; Causey, Richard; Colwell, Wes; Deffner, Joseph; Despain, Tim; Dyson, Fernley; Edgley, Anne; Faldyn, Rodney; Glisan, Ben; Hayslett, Rod; Hermann, Robert; Howard, Kevin A.; Lipshutz, Cheryl; Schnapper, Barry; Sommer, Allan; Sommers, Jeffrey E.; Stubblefield, Wade; Wasaff, George\nCc:\tAlvarez, Gloria; Angelos, Megan; Ashcroft, Beverley; Bachand, Terri; Border, Mary; Bryan, Jennifer; Campos, Kathy; Castillo, Rosie; Dauterive, Inez; Davis, Theresa; Dennard, Virginia; Gray, Dortha; Karsolich, Regina; Keenan, Kate; Kelso, Renee (Michelle); Moody, Bobbie; Reyes, Sonnia; Scott, Nicole; Sczykutowicz, Marion; Tijerina, Shirley; Valdez, Christina\nSubject:\tTime change\n\nThe Joint Accounting/Finance Steering Comm Meeting scheduled for Monday 10/15 at 2:00 is being changed to 1:30 - 2:30 and will be held in the BOARDROOM instead of the dining room.","headers":{"message-id":"<28220691.1075858755487.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 16:30:04 -0700 (PDT)","from":"sally.beck@enron.com","to":"sharron.westbrook@enron.com","subject":"RE: Time change","cc":"christina.valdez@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"christina.valdez@enron.com","x-from":"Beck, Sally </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SBECK>","x-to":"Westbrook, Sharron </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Swestbr>","x-cc":"Valdez, Christina </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cvaldez>","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\SBECK (Non-Privileged)\\Sent Items","x-origin":"Beck-S","x-filename":"SBECK (Non-Privileged).pst"},"subject":"RE: Time change","messageId":"28220691.1075858755487.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"sally.beck@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"sharron.westbrook@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"christina.valdez@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"christina.valdez@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-10-10T23:30:04.000Z"}
