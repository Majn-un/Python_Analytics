{"text":"There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender \nVeto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and \nshould not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered \nlenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks \n$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the \nlender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then \nrequire both OPIC and FMO to consent.\n\n\n\n\nPeter N Anderson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n02/14/2001 10:45 AM\nTo: Rob G Gay/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \n\nSubject: IFC Precedents\n\nRob-\n\nI told Richard that I had no experience with IFC.

The lender of record if the FMO \n(Netherlands Development Finance Corporation) and the structure is modelled \non the IFC \"A\" and \"B\" loan structure. As the \"A\" loan lender, FMO is saying \nthat they want veto rights over all decisions that are to be taken by the \nlenders. Do you know if the IFC has such veto rights in their facilities - \nwill greatly appreciate your feedback on this asap. In addition, does the IFC \nimpose prepayment penalties?\n\nRegards,\nRichard\n\n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<32200711.1075849808550.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Wed, 14 Feb 2001 05:48:00 -0800 (PST)","from":"rob.gay@enron.com","to":"peter.anderson@enron.com","subject":"Re: IFC Precedents","cc":"richard.quek@enron.com","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","bcc":"richard.quek@enron.com","x-from":"Rob G Gay","x-to":"Peter N Anderson","x-cc":"Richard Quek","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Randall_Gay_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent","x-origin":"GAY-R","x-filename":"rgay.nsf"},"subject":"Re: IFC Precedents","messageId":"32200711.1075849808550.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"rob.gay@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"peter.anderson@enron.com","name":""}],"cc":[{"address":"richard.quek@enron.com","name":""}],"bcc":[{"address":"richard.quek@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-02-14T13:48:00.000Z"}
