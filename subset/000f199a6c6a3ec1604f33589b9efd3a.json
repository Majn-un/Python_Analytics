Dan also plans to begin \ndrafting responses to the subpeona.  Since we are a member of WPTF and \ntherefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our \nattorney's coordinate with Dan.  Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n","headers":{"message-id":"<5146846.1075843151459.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Fri, 17 Nov 2000 05:01:00 -0800 (PST)","from":"susan.mara@enron.com","to":"jeff.dasovich@enron.com","subject":"Re: WPTF Subpoena","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"Susan J Mara","x-to":"Jeff Dasovich","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\Jeff_Dasovich_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Notes inbox","x-origin":"DASOVICH-J","x-filename":"jdasovic.nsf"},"subject":"Re: WPTF Subpoena","messageId":"5146846.1075843151459.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"susan.mara@enron.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"jeff.dasovich@enron.com","name":""}],"date":"2000-11-17T13:01:00.000Z"}
