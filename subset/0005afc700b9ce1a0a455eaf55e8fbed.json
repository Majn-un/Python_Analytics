The mantra must leave\n   your hands within 96 hours.\n\n   You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is\n   true even if you are not superstitious.\n\n   Instructions for life in the new millennium from\n   the Dalai Lama:\n\n   1. Take into account that great love and great\n   achievements involve great risk.\n\n   2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.\n\n   3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, respect\n   for others, responsibility for all your actions.\n\n   4. Remember that not getting what you want is\n   sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.\n\n   5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them\n   properly.\n\n   6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great\n   friendship.\n\n   7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take\n   immediate steps to correct it.\n\n   8. Spend some time alone every day.\n\n   9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of\n   your values.\n\n   10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best\n   answer.\n\n   11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get\n   older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.\n\n   12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the\n   foundation for your life.\n\n   13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only\n   with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.\n\n   14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve\n  immortality.\n\n   15. Be gentle with the earth.\n\n   16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been\n   before.\n\n   17. Remember that the best relationship is one in\n   which your love for each\n   other exceeds your need for each other.\n\n   18. Judge your success by what you had to give up\n   in order to get it.\n\n   19. Approach love and cooking with reckless\n   abandon.\n\n   Do not keep this message. The mantra must leave\n   your hands within 96 hours.\n\n   You will get a very pleasant surprise (this is\n   true even if you are not superstitious)\n   if you send it to:\n\n  0-4 people: Your life will improve slightly.\n\n   5-9 people: Your life will improve to your liking.\n\n   9-14 people: You will have at least 5 surprises in\n   the next 3 weeks.\n\n   15 people and above: Your life will improve\n   drastically and everything you\n   ever dreamed of will begin to take shape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","headers":{"message-id":"<5747181.1075840723912.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","date":"Wed, 10 Jan 2001 06:41:00 -0800 (PST)","from":"lillahmay@aol.com","to":"alex3325@yahoo.com, ogorekbartosz@home.com, ryanb@gosfgiants.com, seinfeld21@mail.com, mark.guzman@enron.com, ehowiemaster@aol.com, lauren@mattandlauren.com, jill.vongher@finchcms.edu, kauz@terragon.com, worzle@hotmail.com, orochi@gem.hi-ho.ne.jp, rniles@conmet.com, jsanders@albanychamber.com, heathert@genorth.com","subject":"Fwd: Life","mime-version":"1.0","content-type":"text/plain; charset=us-ascii","content-transfer-encoding":"7bit","x-from":"LillahMay@aol.com","x-to":"alex3325@yahoo.com, ogorekbartosz@home.com, ryanb@gosfgiants.com, seinfeld21@mail.com, mark.guzman@enron.com, EHowieMaster@aol.com, lauren@mattandlauren.com, Jill.Vongher@finchcms.edu, kauz@terragon.com, worzle@hotmail.com, orochi@gem.hi-ho.ne.jp, rniles@conmet.com, jsanders@albanychamber.com, heathert@genorth.com","x-cc":"","x-bcc":"","x-folder":"\\mark guzman 6-28-02\\Notes Folders\\Notes inbox","x-origin":"GUZMAN-M","x-filename":"mark guzman 6-28-02.nsf"},"subject":"Fwd: Life","messageId":"5747181.1075840723912.JavaMail.evans@thyme","priority":"normal","from":[{"address":"lillahmay@aol.com","name":""}],"to":[{"address":"alex3325@yahoo.com","name":""},{"address":"ogorekbartosz@home.com","name":""},{"address":"ryanb@gosfgiants.com","name":""},{"address":"seinfeld21@mail.com","name":""},{"address":"mark.guzman@enron.com","name":""},{"address":"ehowiemaster@aol.com","name":""},{"address":"lauren@mattandlauren.com","name":""},{"address":"jill.vongher@finchcms.edu","name":""},{"address":"kauz@terragon.com","name":""},{"address":"worzle@hotmail.com","name":""},{"address":"orochi@gem.hi-ho.ne.jp","name":""},{"address":"rniles@conmet.com","name":""},{"address":"jsanders@albanychamber.com","name":""},{"address":"heathert@genorth.com","name":""}],"date":"2001-01-10T14:41:00.000Z"}
