I've tied out the fuel retained, used(slightly off,but that's probably ppa's), linepack sales, & electric fuel.\nI'm trying to tie out imbalances.  They are off.  Ken, is putting a B.O. schedule together by contract so I can tie back to the CBS summary report.  Once that's done, it good to go.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tFancler, Dan  \nSent:\tTuesday, July 31, 2001 9:13 AM\nTo:\tMoseley, Debbie\nSubject:\tFW: TW Daily Balance 07/27\n\nDebbie, have we received May/\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGeaccone, Tracy  \nSent:\tFriday, July 27, 2001 8:54 PM\nTo:\tFancler, Dan\nSubject:\tFW: TW Daily Balance 07/27\n\nHave you had much luck checking May info?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPowers, Ken  \nSent:\tFriday, July 27, 2001 2:49 PM\nTo:\tDoll, Jeanette; Donoho, Lindy; Fancler, Dan; Geaccone, Tracy; Harris, Steven; Moore, Jan; Schoolcraft, Darrell; Watson, Kimberly\nSubject:\tTW Daily Balance 07/27\n\nPlease see attached.\n\n << File: TW Daily Balance.pdf >> \n\nI have added the Linepack change to the report, as we discussed in our last meeting.
